# 🌍 Renewable Energy Potential Analysis


👉 [Dashboard](https://gantonnikov.github.io/renewable-energy-potential-analysis/dashboards/dashboard.html)

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates the global landscape of renewable energy through the lens of **10 key research questions**, covering adoption trends, geographic potential, technological progress, and the broader impact on emissions. Each question is backed by targeted visualizations and data analysis.

The research combines global climatology data (NASA POWER), country-level statistics (Our World in Data), and geospatial mapping (RESTCountries API) to explore:

- Long-term trends in renewable energy adoption
- Regional leaders and laggards in electricity generation from renewables
- Global potential for solar and wind energy
- Seasonal variations and climate impact on energy efficiency
- Cost dynamics and decarbonization patterns
- CO₂ emission contributors and sector-wise analysis

The interactive dashboard above highlights selected visualizations in HTML format. Other figures, including bar charts, line plots, and region-specific breakdowns using `matplotlib`, are included in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Methods

- 🌐 **Data Acquisition**:
  - NASA POWER API for historical solar and wind potential
  - RESTCountries API for geolocation and ISO data
  - Our World in Data for renewable electricity, consumption, and emissions

- 📊 **Visualization**:
  - `plotly.express` for interactive web dashboards (hosted via GitHub Pages)
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for bar charts, trendlines, stacked area plots, and more
